Start the server by running the Node.js code on the command line using node index.js

Open Postman and create a new request.

Set the HTTP method to POST.

Enter the URL for the /shorten endpoint, which should be http://localhost:3000/shorten if you're using the default port number.

In the "Body" tab, select "x-www-form-urlencoded" as the format.

Add a key-value pair with the key "url" and the value of the long URL that you want to shorten.

Click the "Send" button to send the request.

If the request was successful, you should receive a JSON response containing the shortened URL and the original URL.

Copy the shortened URL from the response.

Open a new tab in your web browser and paste the shortened URL into the address bar.

If the URL works, it should redirect you to the original URL that you entered in step 11.

Check the console output of the Node.js application to see if the click tracking is working.
